coupons.com-display-all-coupons
===========================================

Interact with website dynamically to load all data (clippable coupons in this case) using a Google Chrome extension.

1. Load the extension in Google Chrome: settings => extensions => check “developer mode” => load unpacked extension
2. Visit "www.coupons.com"
3. A "scissors" icon now appears on the Google Chrome address bar (right side)
4. Now press the "scissors" icon

The extension will keep refreshing the page until all coupons are displayed on the screen. Once the script finishes
running, an alert will display how many coupons were loaded.
